<img id="image" src="https://www.allkeyshop.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/world-of-warcraft-classic-banner1.jpg"</img>
<p>Release Date: November 23, 2004</p>
<p>The core experience! Players explored Azeroth as Horde or Alliance, leveling from 1–60, with iconic zones like Elwynn Forest, Barrens, and Stranglethorn Vale. Raids like Molten Core, Onyxia’s Lair, and Blackwing Lair set the stage for MMO raiding culture.</p>
<p>Player Opinions: Universally praised for its immersive world, deep lore, and social mechanics. However, it required a huge time investment, and some players found it grind-heavy.</p>
<h2>2007: The Burning Crusade (TBC)</h2>

<p> Journey through the Dark Portal to Outland to stop Illidan. New races, Blood Elves and Draenei, were introduced. Level cap raised to 70. </p>     
<p>Player Opinions: Loved for its challenging raids and exotic new zones. PvE players enjoyed challenging raids like Black Temple and Sunwell Plateau, but PvP players criticized the overpowered resilience gear system.</p>
<h2>2008: Wrath of the Lich King (WotLK)</h2>
<img id="image" src="https://i.redd.it/mr9r4z6isrxz.jpg"</img>
<p>Release Date: November 13, 2008</p>
<p>Northrend and the rise of the Lich King (Arthas). Introduced the Death Knight hero class. Iconic raids like Ulduar and Icecrown Citadel. Achievements system debuted, along with more casual-friendly content like 10-player raids and easier dungeon mechanics.</p>
<p>Player Opinions: Regarded as one of the best expansions, combining epic storytelling with accessible gameplay. Hardcore raiders loved Ulduar, while casual players loved the narrative-rich leveling zones.</p>
<h2>2010: Cataclysm</h2>
<img id="image" src="https://img.utdstc.com/screen/b92/be8/b92be88957d98e169e0dbbab1c4463892a0d3404e26709eceac90632d9713ee5:600"</img>
<p>Release Date: December 7, 2010</p>
<p>Deathwing’s return reshaped Azeroth (literally). Revamped many old zones, added two new races: Worgen and Goblins. Zones were reimagined, flying was allowed in Azeroth, and the level cap increased to 85. Raids like Firelands and Dragon Soul were central.</p>
<p>Player Opinions: Mixed. Some loved the world redesign and zones like Deepholm, while others felt the content lacked depth. PvP was particularly unbalanced.</p>
<h2>2012: Mists of Pandaria (MoP)</h2>
<img id="image" src="https://static.playtech.ro/unsafe/1206x678/smart/filters:contrast(5):format(webp):quality(80)/https://playtech.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/MistsOfPandaria1-630x393.jpg"</img>

<p> A new land, Pandaria, inspired by Asian culture. Introduced the Monk class and playable Pandaren race. Flexible raiding formats, scenarios, challenge modes, and the revamped talent system.</p>
<p>Player Opinions: Initially mocked for its "childish" theme (Kung Fu Panda comparisons), but later praised for its deep storytelling and gorgeous environments. Hardcore PvE and PvP players enjoyed the challenge of raids like Throne of Thunder and Siege of Orgrimmar.</p>
<h2>2014: Warlords of Draenor (WoD)</h2>
<img id="image" src="https://warcraft.wiki.gg/images/thumb/6/69/Warlords_of_Draenor_Draenor_loading_screen.jpg/1200px-Warlords_of_Draenor_Draenor_loading_screen.jpg"</img>
<p>Release Date: November 13, 2014</p>
<p>Travel to an alternate Draenor to stop the Iron Horde, led by Grommash Hellscream. Improved graphics, Garrisons (player housing), and challenging raids like Blackrock Foundry.</p>
<p>Player Opinions: A major disappointment due to lack of content updates after launch. Players loved leveling and early raid content, but the game suffered from a long content drought and an overemphasis on Garrisons.</p>
<h2>2016: Legion</h2>

<p>Return of the Burning Legion and Illidan's redemption. Introduced the Demon Hunter class. Artifact weapons, world quests, and Legion invasions. The Emerald Nightmare and Nighthold were iconic raids.</p>
<p>Player Opinions: A massive comeback for WoW. Players loved the engaging storyline, artifact progression, and diverse endgame activities. However, the artifact grind and RNG-based loot were frustrating for some.</p>

<img id="image" src="https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/seo/5766.jpg?1515016737"</img>

<p>Horde vs. Alliance war. New zones: Kul Tiras and Zandalar. Introduced Allied Races. Warfronts, island expeditions, and Uldir raid.</p>

<h2>2020: Shadowlands</h2>
<img id="image" src="https://warcraft.wiki.gg/images/thumb/8/87/Shadowlands_loading_screen.jpg/800px-Shadowlands_loading_screen.jpg"</img>
<p>Release Date: November 23, 2020</p>
<p>Journey into the afterlife to confront Sylvanas and the Jailer. New zones like Revendreth and Ardenweald, Covenant system, and Torghast tower.</p>
<p>Player Opinions: Praised at launch for its new ideas, but Covenant restrictions and lack of endgame content soured opinions. Many players felt disconnected from the story. Still viewed by most players as the worst expansion.</p>

<img id="image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kp8khhF97vgxWw3xbx5mG6.jpg"</img>

<p>The most recent expansion!The expansion delves into the subterranean realms of Azeroth, introducing players to the hidden continent of Khaz Algar. The central narrative focuses on confronting Xal'atath, the Harbinger of the Void, who is amassing forces to threaten Azeroth.</p>
<p>Player Opinions: The expansion received "generally favorable" reviews, with a Metacritic score of 85 based on 35 critic reviews. Some players felt that while the expansion built upon the strengths of its predecessors, it played it a bit safe without introducing groundbreaking changes.</p>
